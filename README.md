# Multithreaded Web Server Simulation

## Overview
This project simulates a multithreaded web server that processes incoming requests using different scheduling algorithms. The simulation provides a graphical user interface (GUI) to visualize how requests are handled by multiple threads, allowing users to switch between First-Come, First-Served (FCFS) and Shortest Job First (SJF) scheduling algorithms.

## Features
- **Multithreading**: Simulates concurrent processing of requests using multiple threads.
- **Scheduling Algorithms**: Supports FCFS and SJF for request handling.
- **GUI Visualization**: Displays request queues, thread processing, and processed requests.
- **Real-time Updates**: Shows queue length and average processing time.
- **Report Generation**: Generates a report of processed requests.

## Installation
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Multi-Threaded-Web-Server-Simulation.git
   cd multithreaded-web-server-simulation
